# Hordes.io User Interface
The goal of this repo is to create an open source replacement for the official Hordes.io UI on top of the game client. 
This will likely take a while to get established and used as a learning project for some folks from the community.
For now, you can join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/hordes) and visit the #coding channel for communication

Running for development, you'll need to run in simultaneously:
```
npm run dev-tsc
npm run dev-rollup
```

To start the dev server, you can run additionally:
```
npm run dev-server
```
This serves the compiled `ui.js` result to `localhost:8080`.

## Implementation Progress
Heres a list of all the necessary components and to which degree they are currently implemented.

### Basic components
These components represent the basic building blocks of the UI. They are used by advanced components, for example the unit frame implements two bars (HP, MP Bar). Basic components never implement advanced components.

|Component|State|Description
|---|---|---|
|Bar|Started|A vertical bar, able to change width based on a fraction, change color, display a left, right, and center text.|
|Icon|Started|A basic square which can be used to display items, buffs and skills. Displays an image, a cooldown overlay, a big centered number, and numbers in the coners. Can drag / receive drop.|
|Panel|Started|A panel for free floating UI elements, can display a header, a close button, optionally have a draggable resize corner, be movable and store/restore its position.|

### Advanced components
These components implement unique elements as well as basic components to generate the actual UI.

|Skill Panel|-|List of known skills using icons, draggable into the Skill Bar.|

### Development tools
Outside of the above components, this repository will provide useful tools that are not part of the UI but help development / testing.
|Task|State|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Component Testbed|-|Test and inspect individual components, fill them with representative values at random.|
|Performance Measurement|-|Spawn many components that are performance critical (bars, unit frames, buffs, items, etc), filling them with representative data and providing performance information.|
|Game Testbed|-|Mimic the game UI by spawning all components in their representative positions, allowing for testing of UI interactions such as dragging items across skillbar / inventory, etc.|
